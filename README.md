# Flipt Client SDKs

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks)](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/blob/main/LICENSE)

This repository centralizes the client-side SDKs for [Flipt](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt).

These client-side SDKs are responsible for evaluating context and returning the results of the evaluation. They enable developers to easily integrate Flipt into their applications without relying on server-side evaluation.

Overall documentation for the client SDKs can be found on our [website](https://www.flipt.io/docs/integration/client).

Also, check out our introductory [blog post](https://www.flipt.io/blog/new-client-side-evaluation) on these client-side SDKs.

## Versions

There are two architectures for the client SDKs:

### FFI

The [Foreign Function Interface (FFI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) versions of the client SDKs are currently available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our FFI SDKs fully support OSes that use the `glibc` implementation of the C standard library. We have beta support for versions of the SDKs that use the `musl` C library. See [this issue](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/141) for which SDKs have versions that support `musl`.

#### Supported Architectures

The FFI-based SDKs are currently supported on the following OSes/architectures:

- Linux x86_64
- Linux arm64
- MacOS x86_64
- MacOS arm64

### WASM

The [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) versions of the client SDKs allow you to evaluate flags in the browser and are OS and architecture agnostic.

## Architecture

The client SDKs are designed to be embedded in end-user applications.

The evaluation logic is written in Rust and can be found in the [flipt-evaluation](./flipt-evaluation/) directory.

The language clients that are used in end-user applications wrap the engine can be found in the `flipt-client-{language}` directories.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Language Support

We are constantly growing our list of supported languages.

### Released

Currently, we support the following languages/platforms:

| Language                                       | Implementation |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Go](./flipt-client-go)                        | FFI            |
| [Python](./flipt-client-python)                | FFI            |
| [Ruby](./flipt-client-ruby)                    | FFI            |
| [NodeJS](./flipt-client-node)                  | WASM           |
| [Java](./flipt-client-java)                    | FFI            |
| [JavaScript (Browser)](./flipt-client-browser) | WASM           |
| [React Web (Browser)](./flipt-client-react)    | WASM           |
| [Flutter/Dart](./flipt-client-dart)            | FFI            |

Documentation for each client can be found in the README of that client's directory.

### Planned

Languages we are planning to support:

1. [Rust](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/83)
1. [C#](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/310)

### Help Wanted

Languages we would like to support but lack expertise in:

1. [Kotlin](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/264)
1. [Swift](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/263)
1. [React Native](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/345)

Want to see a client in a language we don't support? [Open an issue](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-client-sdks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-language&projects=&template=new_language.yml) and let us know!

Alternatively, if you have experience in any of the above languages/platforms we welcome all contributions!! ❤️

## Installation

Please take a look at each client's README for installation and usage instructions.

## Use Cases

Why you may prefer to use a client-side SDK over our server-side SDKs:

1. You want extremely low-latency evaluation and high throughput.
1. You are ok with eventual consistency and can tolerate stale data for a short time.
1. You want to reduce the load in your network by not having each client make a request to the Flipt server for each evaluation.
1. You need evaluation to occur in-process for some reason (e.g. you are evaluating a flag in a web worker).

## Performance

We have done some simple benchmarking to test the performance of the client SDKs vs the server SDKs with Flipt running locally.

![Performance Benchmarks](.github/images/performance.png)

Here we performed 1000 evaluations of a flag using the client SDKs and the server SDKs. The client SDKs were able to perform the evaluations in a fraction of the time it took the server SDKs. This is because the client SDKs can perform the evaluations in memory without having to make a request to the Flipt server.

While the server SDKs performed evaluations in the range of 0-14ms, the client SDKs performed evaluations in the range of 0-0.1ms (100 microseconds).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Help Wanted

We are not Rust experts and are constantly learning. If you see something that can be improved, especially in the [flipt-engine-ffi](./flipt-engine-ffi/) and [flipt-evaluation](./flipt-evaluation/) directories, please open an issue or a PR, we would love to learn from you. :heart:
